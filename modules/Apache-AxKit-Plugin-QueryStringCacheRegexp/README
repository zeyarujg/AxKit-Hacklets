qApache-AxKit-Plugin-QueryStringCacheRegexp version 0.04
=======================================================
DESCRIPTION

This module is a replacement for Apache::AxKit::Plugin::QueryStringCache.
It offers the following at the expense of a little overhead:

The querystring is "taken apart", the parameters are matched against a
positive (*use*) and a negative (*ignore*) pattern, both to be specified
in httpd.conf. A changed order of parameters, old ("&") vs. new-style
(";") delimiters or multiple occurances of the same parameter will not
force AxKit to retransform a document.

Parameters taken into account will have to match the *use*-pattern *and
not* match the *ignore*-pattern (if given).
