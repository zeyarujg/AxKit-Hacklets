Apache-AxKit-Plugin-NotFoundIfPathInfo version 1.01
===================================================

This module is a very simple plugin for AxKit that returns NOT_FOUND if
PATH_INFO has length. It is (obviously) incompatible with modules that
depend on PATH_INFO. (i.E. Apache::AxKit::StyleChooser::PathInfo)

Given you have /this/is/myfile.html on your server and someone requests
GET /this/is/myfile.html/bla/bla, AxKit will happily serve myfile.html
and put /bla/bla in the PATH_INFO. This behaviour can get anoying under
circumstances: Someone creates a loop with broken relative links
and a stupid webspider starts to crawl through these...
