=head1 NAME

Apache::AxKit::MediaChooser::QueryString - Choose media using querystring

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  AxAddPlugin Apache::AxKit::MediaChooser::QueryString

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you pick a media based on the querystring. 
To use it, simply add this module as an AxKit plugin that 
will be run before main AxKit processing is done.

  AxAddPlugin Apache::AxKit::MediaChooser::QueryString

By default, the key name of the name/value pair is 'media'.
This can be changed by setting the variable AxMediaChooserQueryStringKey
in your httpd.conf:

  PerlSetVar AxMediaChooserQueryStringKey mymedia

Then simply by referencing your xml files as follows:

  http://xml.server.com/myfile.xml?media=printable
  
or

  http://xml.server.com/myfile.xml?mymedia=printable

respectively - you will recieve the alternate mediasheets with title
"printable". See the HTML 4.0 specification for more details on
mediasheet choice.

See the B<AxMediaName> AxKit configuration directive
for more information on how to setup named medias.
